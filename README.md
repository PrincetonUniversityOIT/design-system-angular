# Princeton Design System

## Getting Started

The instructions below assume that you have Node/NPM properly installed on your system.

After cloning the repo to your local system, be sure to install the project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

You will want to run the build for the Angular components and CSS before running the server.

```
ng build
```

After that you should be ready to run the site locally.

```
npm run storybook
```
